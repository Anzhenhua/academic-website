abstract: As a carbon-free fuel, ammonia has attracted significant attention. However, its low reactivity challenges its application in the realistic combustion system. It is a feasible strategy to enhance ammonia flame using online cracking since the cracked hydrogen could increase the stability, making it more similar to methane flame to realize the replacement. The present work investigates the partially cracked NH3/air flame in a model gas turbine. Experiment and the large eddy simulation coupled with flamelet generated manifold (FGM) model are used. Three NH3/air cracking ratio cases (cracking ratio, Cr = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6) are investigated. And the CH4 flame under a similar power value condition is also studied for comparison. The results indicate that when the ammonia cracking ratio reaches 40%, the flame structure and heat release characteristics are similar to pure methane flame, but the NO emission increases in cracking cases.
