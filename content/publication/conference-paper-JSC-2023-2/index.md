abstract: Liquid ammonia needs to co-fired with small-molecular fuels, such as methane, to achieve stable combustion, and liquid ammonia will undergo flash boiling under relatively low ambient pressure. Those features multiple fuel streams and strong local heat loss, posing challenges to the flamelet modelling of liquid ammonia combustion. To this end, this study aims to evaluate the flamelet-based models for liquid ammonia combustion. Firstly, a three-dimensional Carrier-Phase Direct Numerical Simulation (CP-DNS) was conducted to explore the combustion characteristics of a liquid ammonia/methane co-fired flame in a temporally evolving mixing layer. The results revealed multiple stages in the liquid ammonia/methane co-fired flame, namely, the mixing stage, methane-dominated stage, and main reaction stage. Subsequently, flamelet-based models were developed with the complex fuel streams, strong local heat loss, and combustion modes considered, and their performances were assessed through a priori analyses.
