abstract: Directly using liquid ammonia in combustion devices can simplify the fuel supply system and reduce equipment costs. However, the detailed ignition and propagation mechanisms of liquid ammonia flames have not been fully understood. This study aims to investigate the ignition and propagation of liquid ammonia flames numerically under various conditions. Spherically expanding liquid ammonia flames are studied using detailed chemistry. The effects of initial temperatures, droplet diameters, equivalence ratios, and heat fraction are investigated. The results indicate that the rapid flash boiling of liquid ammonia droplets leads to a strong local heat loss, hindering the ignition and propagation of the flame. Preheating can significantly increase the reaction rate, which compensates for the heat loss caused by phase change, allowing the flame kernel to ignite and propagate outwards. While droplet-flame interaction is present but not significant due to the rapid evaporation of liquid ammonia. The effect of droplet on the flame surface curvature is only distinguishable at conditions of large diameter. Equivalence ratio and ammonia heat fraction ratio change the amount of liquid ammonia.
