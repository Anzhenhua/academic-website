abstract: A laboratory-scale liquid ammonia jet flame is investigated using Carrier-Phase Direct Numerical Simulation (CP-DNS) with a detailed reaction mechanism (Combust. Flame 204(2019)162175), which includes 42 chemical species and 130 reactions. The validity of the CP-DNS is evaluated by comparing the simulation results with the experimental data. Subsequently, flame structure and combustion characteristics are explored in detail. The results show that strong heat loss caused by the flash boiling significantly reduces the local heat release. From upstream to downstream, the combustion reactions are affected by different degrees of phase change. Notably, NO formation is much more significant in the downstream due to the higher ammonia concentration and local temperature.
