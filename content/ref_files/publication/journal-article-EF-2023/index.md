abstract: Alcohol-to-Jet Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (AtJ-SPK), an approved sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by blending with conventional Jet A fuel, has recently been experimentally studied, and detailed mechanisms have been developed to describe its combustion behavior. The present study aims to develop reduced mechanisms of AtJ-SPK and its blends with Jet A for high-fidelity and computationally affordable computational fluid dynamics. Specifically, two reduced mechanisms were developed for pure AtJ-SPK and its blends with Jet A from LLNL-AtJ-SPK [Richter et al. Combust. Flame 2022, 240, 111994] and POLIMI detailed mechanisms [Ranzi et al. Prog. Energy Combust. Sci. 2012, 38 (4), 468â€“501], respectively, using a combined reduction method. The reduced mechanisms can achieve 80%/92.4% and 92%/90% reductions of the species/reaction numbers, respectively, compared with those of the master detailed mechanisms. The developed reduced mechanisms were further validated under various conditions by comparing the predicted ignition delay times, laminar flame speeds, and temporal/spatial profiles with those predicted using the master detailed mechanisms as well as experimental data. Finally, the computational cost comparison in the two-dimensional direct numerical simulation demonstrated that the developed reduced mechanisms can impressively accelerate the calculation speed by more than 5000 and 529 times, respectively.
